# work-day-scheduler

## Motivation

The motivation for this project was to design a schedule which would enable the user to list out events for the current work day and save them locally to refer to at a later time.

## Description

The scheduler automtically displays the current day and time at the top of the page. The hours listed within the time blocks of the scheduler will always represent standard working hours, so that the user may track events or tasks they need to complete during those hours. Depending on the time of day relative to the assigned time in each time block, the text fields will appear as either grey, red, or green depending on whether that particular time block exists in the past, present, or future of the current day, respectively. When the user clicks the save button for any given time block, the event(s) logged will be saved to the local storage to be viewed upon reloading the page at a later time.
